# MBK Library

The app is a full-stack web application that allows users to browse and check out books from a library collection. The home page features a search bar and carousel displaying top books. Users can search by book or category, view book details such as author, description, and ratings, leave reviews, and check out books. The app is responsive and includes a shelf page where users can manage their loans, a history page to view past loans, and a library services page to ask questions to the admin. The app includes roles and responsibilities, with an admin page to manage book quantities and respond to messages. Each page has a stateful and an empty state associated with it. The app is built using React and Spring Boot.
